## 1. Prerequisites

 Make sure you have F# installed. This can be done in several different ways:
* Install F# with visual studio

1. If you're downloading Visual Studio for the first time, it will first install Visual Studio Installer. Install the appropriate edition of Visual Studio from the installer.

If you already have Visual Studio installed, choose Modify next to the edition you want to add F# to.

2. On the Workloads page, select the ASP.NET and web development workload, which includes F# and .NET Core support for ASP.NET Core projects.

3. Choose Modify in the lower right-hand corner to install everything you've selected.

You can then open Visual Studio with F# by choosing Launch in Visual Studio Installer.

* Install F# in visual studio code

1. Ensure you have git installed and available on your PATH. You can verify that it's installed correctly by entering git --version at a command prompt and pressing Enter.

2. Install the .NET SDK and Visual Studio Code.

3. Select the Extensions icon and search for "Ionide":

The only plugin required for F# support in Visual Studio Code is Ionide-fsharp. However, you can also install Ionide-FAKE to get FAKE support and Ionide-Paket to get Paket support. FAKE and Paket are additional F# community tools for building projects and managing dependencies, respectively.


## 2. Clone Repository

Clone the repository to local machine [Clone Repository].
```
git clone https://github.com/tasamai/TextAdventureGame.git
```

## 3. Running Project

You can run this project on your local machine through the console while developing or you can build in using the command below. Please ensure you have the .NET CLI installed. If you installed f# from the .NET SDK, there is no need for this

### `dotnet build`

## 4. Languages & Technologies
      
      1. F#
      2. .NET
      3. ASP.NET

## 5. Learning Outcomes

      In building the project, I learnt the fundamentals of functional programming, recussion, pure functions, immutable variables, Referential transparency etc. It also helped me to demonstrate my understand of F# and the .NET suite.
